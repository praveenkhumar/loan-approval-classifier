# Loan Approval Classifier 🏦✅

A binary classification machine learning model to predict whether a loan will be approved based on applicant information.

> Developed using Logistic Regression with Scikit-learn in Google Colab.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Financial institutions receive thousands of loan applications. This project helps automate the initial loan approval process using historical applicant data.

---

## 🔍 Dataset

- Sample dataset includes features like:
  - Gender, Married, Education
  - Applicant Income
  - Loan Amount
  - Credit History
  - Property Area

> Target Column: `Loan_Status` (Y = Approved, N = Rejected)

---

## 🧪 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Label encoding for categorical features
- Train-test split
- Logistic Regression model training
- Accuracy & classification report
- Confusion matrix heatmap
- Predictions comparison table

---

## 📊 Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: ~94%
- Evaluated using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Actual vs Predicted comparison

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

---
